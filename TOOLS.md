#Â Tools

## Visualization 

Some scripts in `tools` will generate a "map" of your dump, as well as tiles to be rendered in a Leaflet based
visualization thing in your browser.

*BE CAREFUL, THESE OPERATIONS TAKE A LOT OF SPACE*
*COUNT 6 TIMES THE SIZE OF YOUR FLASH DUMP*

What you are seeing is all the pages stacked together, then the very "high" column is split into 8 smaller colums, that
are then stitched together horizontally.

## Installation / Usage

You need to have `libvips-tools` installed.

Just run the script with a dump file and a page size, and wait for a bit

```
$ bash tools/viz.sh flash_3.bin  $((2048+64))
